AIPY (Astronomical Interferometry in PYthon)

DESCRIPTION
    This package collects together tools for radio astronomical interferometry.
    In addition to pure-python phasing, calibration, imaging, and
    deconvolution code, this package includes interfaces to MIRIAD (a Fortran
    interferometry package) and HEALPix (a package for representing spherical 
    data sets), and some math/fitting routines from SciPy.

INSTALLATION
    This is a *nix package.  With some trouble it can install on intel-based
    Macs. It probably doesn't install on Windows. You need to have
    python >= 2.4 (and < 3.0 for now).  AIPY depends on the following 
    python packages:
        numpy >= 1.2
        pyephem >= 3.7.3
        pyfits >= 1.3
        *matplotlib >= 0.98.3
        *matplotlib-basemap >= 0.99
        (* installation can proceed without these, but some scripts won't work)

    INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES
        OPTION 1 (safest): Manually install the dependencies.
        OPTION 2 (experimental): Open up the AIPY download, and with network
            connectivity and root access, type:
            $ install_required.sh
            and then (if you want matplotlib/basemap):
            $ install_recommended.sh

    INSTALL AS ROOT
        > sudo python setup.py install

    INSTALL AS USER
        You'll first install to a directory of your choice:
        $ python setup.py install --install-lib <module_dir> \
            --install-scripts <scripts_dir>
        This puts the python module in <module_dir>, and the command-line 
        scripts in <scripts_dir>.  The next thing is to tell python where to 
        look for the python module.  This is done by setting the PYTHONPATH 
        variable to point to <module_dir>.  In bash, this looks like:
        $ export PYTHONPATH=<module_dir>
        However, you'll have to type this every time you open a terminal.  To
        avoid this, add the export line to the .bashrc file in your home dir.

    COMMAND-LINE SCRIPTS
        Unless you installed as user, these will be in /usr/bin.  For more info
        use the "-h" option with any of these commands:

DOCUMENTATION
    If you want to build html documentation, you'll first need sphinx on 
    your system:
        > easy_install -U sphinx
    Then you should be able to cd into the doc directory and run:
        > make html
    The results will appear in doc/build/html.  There are plenty of other 
    build options, too.  Many thanks to Jayce Dowell for his work on this.

Enjoy,
Aaron Parsons

PACKAGE INFO FOR DEVELOPERS
    The subpackage "optimize" was copied in from scipy-0.6.0, and then all
    code that depended on non-pure-python modules was removed.  If these ever 
    need to be updated, download scipy source and copy scipy/scipy/optimize 
    into aipy, and then remove any code deemed unnecessary.  Unfortunately, 
    then you may need to crawl through the code and replace all "scipy" 
    references with "aipy".

    The subpackage "_cephes" was copied in from scipy-0.6.0/special, and then
    all but the cephes and c_misc code was removed to avoid needing a Fortran
    compiler.  _cephesmodule.c needed substantial editing to remove external
    dependencies.

    The miriad source code (aipy/miriad/mirsrc) was included from 
    MIRIAD-4.0.5.  To update, download miriad source and copy $MIR/src/subs/* 
    and $MIR/src/inc/* into aipy/miriad/mirsrc.  Not all files are used, but 
    include them all anyway.

    Healpix source code (aipy/healpix/cxx) was included from Healpix-2.01.
    To update, download healpix source and copy src/cxx into aipy/healpix.
