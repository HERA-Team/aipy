\section{Module: aipy.coord}

An astronomy library for precessing coordinates between epochs and converting 
between topocentric (z = up, x = east), ecliptic (heliocentric), equatorial
(celestial), and galactic coordinate systems.  Vectors are 3 dimensional 
with magnitude 1, representing a point on the unit sphere.  Includes generic 
3 vector rotation code.
